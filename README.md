# Heat-Pipe-Reactor
# Instructions (version 0.0.1)
# Before use: Make sure that there is no .vtu or .fld existing in folder !!!!! This might cause some unexpected bugs!!!!!

This is simulation code for heat pipe reactor (KRUSTY 1/8 model).

Completed:

    (a)Neutronics simulation 
    (b)Temperature simulation in solid area

To do:

    (a)Fluid calculation in heat pipe
    (b)Thermal expansion simulation
    (c)Burn-up calculation
    (d)3D-modeling


1.Unit: length(cm),temperature(K). Others are SI units.

2.Define_OpenMC.py includes functions for operating OpenMC:

    (a)define_Geo_Mat_Set: This function is used to generate  geometry.xml, material.xml and settings.xml.
    
    (b)postProcess: This function is used to post-proccess heating source distribution and generate forcing function for Nektar++.
    
    (c)editCellTemperature: This function is used to edit temperature of cells in geometry.xml.

3.Define_Nektar.py includes functions for operating Nektar++:

    (a)runNektar: Just as its name. Of cause, It can generate .fld and convert it to .vtu that we need.
    
    (b)postProcess: It can post-process results of temperature and generate temperature function in fuel area and coefficients of this function.
    
    (c)fuelTemperature: It can use temperature function to generate avarage temperature in cells.

For more details, please check codes respectively.

You can get the parameters of KRUSTY and thermal properties of fuel from the following reference papers.
